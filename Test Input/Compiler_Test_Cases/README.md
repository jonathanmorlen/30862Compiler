This is a test set for the compiler. You do not need to test if you have the exact same binary,
you only need to test if when ran through the interpreter it produces the same output. You can use
our interpreter here to test if your binary is working properly, as here we are just grading the
compiler and not the interpreter. 

The tests are divided up according to the diagram Test_Cases.png located in this folder. I recommend
that you start at 1 and work your way down to 7. The last two test cases are not finished yet but
will be added later.

Compiler_Inputs - What you will feed into your program.
Compiler_Binary_Output - The binary our compiler produced.
Interpreter_Output - The output our interpreter gave for the produced binaries.
